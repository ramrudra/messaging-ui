# messaging-ui repo

All the relevant components should be here.  Note that for development, the `tab` is fixed by a `prop` in all of the `messages: *` stories, so clicking another tab will not change the content.

### Scripts

`npm start` - This will start the `react-storybook` server with hot-reloading.

`npm run test` - This will run `jest`

`npm run build-storybook` - This will create a `static` version of the `storybook` in the `.out` directory.


### Firebase

The firebase config details are located in `firebaseConfig.js` in the root directory.
